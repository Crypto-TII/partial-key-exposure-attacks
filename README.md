# Partial Key Exposure Attacks on BIKE, Rainbow and NTRU

This project provides the code to rerun the experiments of the paper "Partial Key Exposure Attacks on BIKE, Rainbow and NTRU" by Andre Esser, Alexander May, Javier Verbel and Weiqiang Wen. 

All code necessary to execute the experiments is provided in the python notebook files. The ``rainbow.py`` file includes the used routines for Rainbow key generation. Make sure the file is in the same folder as the notebook file.
